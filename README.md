## 🚀 What is LeetDirect?

LeetDirect is a lightweight and handy browser extension that lets you open any LeetCode problem with a single click — just by typing its number.

Ever heard someone say:
> "Let's solve LeetCode problem #123 — one of the FAANG favorites..."

…and wished you could instantly open it? That’s exactly what LeetDirect is built for!

## 💡 Why LeetDirect?

While learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), I noticed how often people refer to LeetCode problems by number. Jumping to a specific problem wasn’t intuitive — so I built this tool to change that.

Whether you're:
- Following tutorials and want quick access to problem numbers
- Looking to challenge yourself with a random number
- Or just want a fast and clean way to access problems…

**LeetDirect is for you.**
